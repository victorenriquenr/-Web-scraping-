Hello, and thanks for stopping by! This repository contains examples of web scraping I've written for solo projects while I practice and enhance my scraping skills.


# ** Latest researh articles (Nature.com)**:

I'm sharing a set of practice scripts to extract research articles in physics, computer science and mathematics. It includes essential metadata such as title, abstract, citations, accesses, online attention, publication date, and topic. I hope it proves useful to you. I will expand the feature set and include as many topics and metrics as possible.
